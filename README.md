# Humidity-Data-Analysis
Using matplotlib, graphs were plotted in python to demonstrate the trends of Relative humidity % (RH%) over time, RH sensor temperature over time, and dewpoint temperature over time using data from a csv file. 

# RH Sensor Temperature

Graph showing the the changes in RH sensor temperature over time with data obtained from csv file. 

# Absolute Humidity
